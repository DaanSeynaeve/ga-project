Cannot be optimal. Visibile inneffiencies in the tour. Can be optimized by changing only 2 edges. (sometimes)

run 1
Best solution was already there 50 generations ago

run2
not the case


minder generaties (100 default):
50: 3.81, 4.10, 4.01, 3.56, 3.81
(meer crossing edges)
(greater tour length)

25: 3.94, 4.17, 3.57, 4.2, 4.3


minder individuals (50 default):
25: 4.07, 3.55, 3.58, 3.64, 3.07
(less diversity)

meer indivduals:
200: 3.49, 3.45, 3.35, 3.36, 3.41
(consistent result, no crossing edges)

No elites:
(No convergence, oscillating, random behaviour)
bad results
more generations --> no influence
more individuals --> less extreme oscillation. Average fitness levels out. Seems to be stuck at suboptimal solutions.

More individuals warrants more elite?

High amount of elites -> stuck at specific solutions for a long time. Population converges to a single fitness value.

Enabling loop detection -> much better performance. Faster saturation + convergence.

Prob. for mutation or crossover must be high enough for anything to happen...

If no mutation -> algo can become 'stuck'.

no mutation + low crossover prob -> algo comes to an early stop.

crossover increasingly important for larger problem instances?
